# Summer STEM Academy at UCA - Data Analysis and Visualization

Welcome to the Summer STEM Academy at UCA!

My name is Michelle Talley and I am the instructor for the data analysis & visualization portion of the course.

In my sessions, you will learn to analyze data using Python and Jupyter notebooks.  You will use this environment to analyze data from their own experiments focused on the biological, chemical, and physical factors responsible for seed dispersal and seed germination.
